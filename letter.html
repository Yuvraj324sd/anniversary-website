  <h1>A Letter to Our Future Selves :)üíó</h1>

  <p>Hey, my love, my wife, you just got prettier didn‚Äôt you? Hahahaha. We did overcome this distance. We didn‚Äôt prove ourselves weak, did we babe? Or‚Ä¶ at that time, wife?</p>
  <p>When you both grow up and look back at what you were, you would just realize how deeply in love were you two. Just like lovebirds, or to be honest, more than lovebirds. From talking about cuddling and stuff to doing it IRL? Yes, we can‚Äôt wait. We share a lot of dreams, and we would succeed in each one of them.</p>
  <p>Just an online relationship? An ordinary one? Nope, this isn‚Äôt just a relationship‚Äîthis is a tie, this is a bond which has tied two soulmates together. When you grow up, my love, don‚Äôt forget where we started heheheheh, how we proposed, everything (I would still tease you, and I have complete rights to do so).</p>
  <p>You remember how shy you were at first? And now look at you‚Äîglowing with confidence, still mine, and still just as cute. Actually no, even cuter. Like how do you keep leveling up your cuteness, huh? I swear if hearts could explode, mine would be scattered across the sky like fireworks just watching you smile.</p>
  <p>You always thought you weren‚Äôt good enough sometimes, but now look at you‚Äîmy wife, the woman of my dreams, the one who made even the darkest days look beautiful. You are literally the softest light in my life. Even when I was tired, lost, or just done with everything, one text from you would fix it all. How do you do that magic?</p>
  <p>And when we used to send each other those long goodnights, full of emojis and baby words, hahahah, people would cringe, but I swear I‚Äôd re-read them a hundred times. And you? You‚Äôre the only one who could make me smile while crying, laugh while hurting, and dream while wide awake.</p>
  <p>I know life gets busy, and we might have our share of little arguments (and yes, I‚Äôll still win them all, because *I‚Äôm right*... kidding, you always win by just giving me that pretty stare), but I just want you to know, even when things get tough, I‚Äôll always pick *us*. Every single time.</p>
  <p>And you still blush when I compliment you, don‚Äôt you? Still hiding that cute face when I call you my queen? Don‚Äôt ever change. You‚Äôre my sunshine. My favorite person. The only human who can destroy me with a smile but also save me with a hug.</p>
  <p>We‚Äôve come so far. From late-night calls to waking up beside each other (yeah yeah, I know I snore, don‚Äôt remind me). From sending hearts to sharing actual moments. From ‚Äúsomeday‚Äù to *today*.</p>
  <p>If you're ever reading this in a moment of doubt, babe, just know: you are everything I ever wanted. Everything I‚Äôll ever need. I‚Äôm proud of you. I believe in you. And even in the next life‚Äîif I have to‚ÄîI‚Äôll find you again. I promise.</p>
